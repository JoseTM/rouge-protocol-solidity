# The Rouge Project - factory and campaign contracts

> solidity contracts used by the Rouge protocol

The Rouge protocol is an open-source blockchain voucher and note
protocol built as a suite of smart contracts using a specific token —
the Rouge token — on Ethereum compatible blockchains (tested on
Ethereum and POA).

Rouge is for all types of usage of non-repudiable and unique usage
digital vouchers (for example, e-tickets, e-coupons, cashback notes,
etc).

This package includes low-level implementation of the protocol
in solidity.

The Javascript [rouge.js](https://github.com/TheRougeProject/rouge.js)
library, is a far simpler and recomended method to use the protocol
than using these contracts directly.

Please check out the [Rouge protocol docs](https://rouge.network/docs/).

## How to run tests :

``` bash
cd rouge-protocol-solidity
npm install
npm run test
```
